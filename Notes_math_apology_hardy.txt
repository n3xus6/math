A Mathematicians's Apology, G. H. Hardy, 1940

- Exposition, criticism, appreciation, is work for second-rate minds.
- Good work is not done by humble men.
- Most people can do nothing at all well.
- A gift for mathematics is one of the most specialized talents.
- Mathematics is a young man's game.
- Newton recognized by the time he was forty that his greatest creative days were over.
- Galois died at twenty-one, Abel at twenty-seven, Ramanujan at thirty-three, Riemann at forty.
- Mathematics is, if an unprofitable, a perfectly harmless and innocent occupation.
- A man's first duty is to be ambitious.
- Motives which may lead men to prosecute research: intellectual curiosity, professional pride, ambition.
- Languages die, mathematical ideas do not.
- A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns.
- The mathematician's patterns, like the painter's or the poet's must be beautiful.
- Very little of mathematics is useful practically, and that little is comparatively dull. Practical consequences are usually negligible.
- Reductio ad absurdum is one of a mathematician's finest weapons.
- The fundamental theory of arithmetic: any integer can be resolved, in one way only, into a product of primes.
- Fermat's two square theorem: primes may be arranged in two classes; the primes which leave remainder 1 when divided by 4, and the primes which leave remainder 3.
- I said that a mathematician was a maker of patterns of ideas, and that beauty and seriousness were the criteria by which his patterns should be judged.
- Primes are the raw material out of which we have to build arithmetic.
- Physical reality = the material world.
- For most mathematicians, there is another reality and there is no sort of agreement about the nature of mathematical reality.
- Some hold that it is mental and that in some sense we construct it, others that it is outside and independent of us.
- I believe that mathematical reality lies outside us, that our function is to discover it. Our creations are simply our notes of our observations. This view has been held by many philosophers from Plato onwards.
- Real mathematics must be justified as arts if it can be justified at all.
- Real mathematics has no effects on war. Trivial mathematics has many applications in war.
- I have done one the thing you could never have done, and that is to have collaborated with both Littlewood and Ramanujan on something like equal terms.
- A mathematician may still be competent enough at sixty, but if it is useless to expect him to have original ideas.
